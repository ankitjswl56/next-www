                            JavaScript is possibly the most important programming language in the world. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The Economic Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.

                            The first version of JavaScript was called Mocha. Shortly after the Mocha prototype was introduced in Netscape Communicator (May 1995), it was renamed LiveScript. It was then renamed JavaScript. Marc Andreessenâ€™s founder wanted to make the web more dynamic by making animations and user interaction. He wanted to make Netscape Communicator more attractive to developers by equipping it with an enterprise-level coding language (Java) and a smaller scripting language (JavaScript). Although the initial plan was to add interactivity, today, it has evolved into helping build mobile apps and high-performance servers.
